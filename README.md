*[WIP]* Ball and Socket Motor
--- 
note: very early stages of implementation,

This repo is an exploration on the feasibility of a spherical joint motor controlled via magnetic field shaping. 
The idea here is to arrange X number of electromagnets on a hemisphere(the "ball") with an overlayed hemisphere, arranged with permanent magnets. By controlling the current on each electromagnet, we can shape the magnetic field coming radially out of the hemisphere. You can guess where this is going in that we can then control the position of the overlayed hemisphere 


There's one implementation of this in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10328708 , but I believe I can make this at home, hopefully better
